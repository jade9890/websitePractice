    <h1>My Investing Journey</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I began investing once I turned 18 and opened an easytrade account through TD bank. Initially, I made some profits after waiting a bit, but fast forward 6 months or so and I open another account using IBKR. I decided I wanted to daytrade and was confident I could make it big. Low and behold, that did that happen and I lost quite a bit of money. Definitely one of the worst times in the year. Took a couple months off, as I wasn't in the best mental state for trading and I also had a lot of things going on in my life. Anyways! I don't think I'll daytrade again since it's too risky for me. However I'm not done my trading journey, and a couple months back I opened my direct investing account through TD again. I supposed I'm leaning more towards swing trading now, and so far it's going well. It's only been a bit over a year since I started investing, but I'm determined to improve my strategies and achieve my goals!</p>
